# Custom-Splash-Script-for-ReiNX-GUI

![Preview](he.PNG?raw=true)

This program is a simple GUI for the already existing Custom Splash Script for ReiNX. Other than the fact that I added a preview, not much is to be said. This is a component of [Unofficial ReiNX SD Stash Updater](https://github.com/lunalik2/Unofficial-ReiNX-SD-Stash-Updater). All credit goes to TheExpertNoob for creating the orginal script.
